- dm blast command with invites to players (can include custom msg)
- potentially, instead of grabbing memberlist from voice channel members, grab it based on reactions to some post by bot (either in DM or text channel)
- handle edge cases for registration (e.g. wrong popflash link for a given discord ID)
